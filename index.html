            <article>
                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
                    Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has since become one of the most
                    popular programming languages in the world. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability and
                    simplicity, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.</p>
                <p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional
                    programming. This flexibility allows developers to choose the best approach for their projects.
                    Python's extensive standard library, often referred to as "batteries included," provides modules and
                    packages that facilitate various tasks, from web development to data analysis.</p>
                <p>One of Python's key features is its dynamic typing, which allows variables to change type during
                    execution. This can lead to more flexible and concise code, although it may also introduce runtime
                    errors if not handled carefully. Additionally, Python's memory management is handled by an automatic
                    garbage collector, reducing the need for manual memory allocation and deallocation.</p>
                <p>Python's ecosystem includes a vast array of third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Django for
                    web development, Pandas for data analysis, and TensorFlow for machine learning. These libraries,
                    combined with Python's ease of use, make it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.
                </p>
                <p>Example: Hello World in Python</p>
                <code>
                print("Hello, World!")
               </code>
            </article>

            <header>Python Data Structures</header>
            <article>
                <p>Python provides several built-in data structures that are essential for writing efficient and
                    readable code. These include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Understanding how to use these
                    data structures effectively is crucial for any Python developer.</p>
                <ul id="Python_Data_Structures_list">
                    <li id="Python_Data_Structures_listitems">
                        <header>Lists</header>
                        <p>Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items. They can store items of different types and
                            are indexed starting from zero. Lists are versatile and can be used for a wide range of
                            applications, from simple collections to complex data manipulations.</p>
                        <p>Example: Creating and Manipulating a List</p>
                        <code>"fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>fruits.append("date")
                        <br>print(fruits)
                        <br># Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li id="Python_Data_Structures_listitems">
                        <header>Tuples</header>
                        <p>Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are useful for storing fixed collections of items and can help protect data from accidental modification.</p>
                        <p>Example: Creating a Tuple</p>
                        <code>coordinates = (10, 20)
                            <br>print(coordinates)
                            <br># Output: (10, 20)
                        </code>
                    </li>

                        <header>Dictionaries</header>
                        <p>Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They allow for fast retrieval of values based on their keys and are useful for storing and manipulating structured data.</p>
                        <p>Example: Creating and Using a Dictionary</p>
                        <code>student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 23, "major": "Computer Science"}
                            <br>print(student["name"])
                            <br># Output: Alice

                        <header>Sets</header>
                        <p>Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries from a collection.</p>
                        <p>Example: creating and Using a set</p>
                        <code>unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}

            <header>Control Flow in Python</header>
            <article>
                <p>Control flow statements in Python determine the order in which statements are executed. These include conditional statements, loops, and exception handling.</p>
                <ul id="Control_Flow_in_Python_list">

                        <header>Conditional Statements</header>
                        <p>Conditional statements allow the execution of different blocks of code based on certain conditions. The primary conditional statements in Python are 'if' , 'elif' ,and 'else'</p>
                        <p>Example: Using Conditional Statements</p>
                        <code>
                            "age = 18
                            <br>if age < 18:
                                <br>print("Minor")
                            <br>elif age == 18:

                        <header>Loops</header>
                        <p>Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.</p>
                        <p>Example: Using a 'for' Loop
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            for i in range(5):

                        </code>
                        <p>Example: Using a 'while' Loop

                        <p>Exception handling in Python is done using try, except, else, and finally blocks. It allows for graceful handling of errors and ensures that resources are cleaned up properly.</p>

            <header>Object Oriented Programming in Python</header>
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. Python supports OOP, enabling developers to create reusable and modular code.</p>

                    <p>A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors. An object is an instance of a class, with its own set of attributes and methods.</p>
